        <p class="text"><strong>Chiles Rellenos</strong> are a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the state of Puebla.<br>
            The most common pepper used is Puebla's poblano chilis, though New Mexico chilis, pasilla, or even jalape√±os are popular as well.<br>
            It is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as queso Chihuahua, Oaxaca or Panela; or with shredded meat made of pork or chicken.<br>
            This recipe uses Poblano chilis with a Panela cheese stuffing.
