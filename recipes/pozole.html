        <p class="text"><strong>Pozole</strong> is a traditional soup or stew from Mexican cuisine.<br>
            Prepared in Mexico since the pre-Columbian era, today this dish is common across Mexico and is served both as a day-to-day meal and as a fetive meal.<br>
            It is claimed that this dish was originally prepared with human meat, but for <em>legal reasons</em> this recipe uses pork instead.

        <h3 class="text">Cooking:</h3>
        <ol class="text list">
            <li>Boil the 5L of water with the meat until soft. This process may take a couple of hours, depending of the type of meat you used.<br>
                Continuously skim the foam from the top of the broth.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the tomatoes, onion, garlic, chilis cumin, salt and pepper in a blender with a bit of water.<br>
                You can use some of the same broth from the meat for added flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Once the meat is soft, add the hominy corn and the bay leaves, then cook for another 1.5 hours, or until the corn gets soft.</li>
            <li>Once the corn is soft, add the previously blended misture into the pot and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with chopped radish, lettuce, onion, oregano, some lemon juice and a side of tostadas.</li>
